# Recoverability_of_ARG_topologies
Matlab code to accompany the paper of the same name.

The code for each problem is most often divided into 3 sections: 
(1) a return function will return the value of a probability matrix entry if feasible indices are called, or 0 otherwise. This is a useful helpful function which keeps the main code tidy,
(2) a solve function iterates through a given series of recursions and returns a solution matrix.,
(3) a plotter function extracts data from the solution matrix and was used to create all the graphs used in the paper.
